# FSO-part-5
In this project I have created a blog-list app using React (in particular functional components and useState, useEffect and useRef hooks) where the user can read, add, edit and delete a list of his/her favourite articles.

In the app I have also implemented unit testing with Jest and E2E testing with Cypress.

The app is connected to a backend server created with Node.js and Express, connected to a mongoDB.

Here is a link to the backend GitHub repository: https://github.com/Manu-sing/FSO-part-4

And here is the app deployed on Heroku: https://manu-blog-list.herokuapp.com/
